# shelf_tracker
This program detects objects in the front row of a shelf and updates an inventory displayed in the top-left corner. When an object is removed, it is automatically removed from the inventory. Likewise, if a new object is placed in the front row, it is added to the inventory. This ensures real-time tracking of the shelf's visible items.
